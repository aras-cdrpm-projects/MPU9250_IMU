# MPU9250 IMU
This is an STM32 Based IMU For robotic applications. The MPU9250 driver code is based on the library from <a href="https://github.com/bolderflight/MPU9250/" target="_blank">link</a>. There are some subversions of this port in this repository:
- SPI interface to the sensor and USB as the output
- SPI interface to the sensor and CAN as the output
- I2C interface to the sensor and USB as the output.

Moreover, This project exploits the abstraction provided by the STM HAL library.
